Provides the worth reading material
 I'm a driven person who works hard to attain my goals. The ability to overcome obstacles and follow things through to completion has always been a strong point of mine. However, I am aware that as a perfectionist my delegation skills could be improved.
And I think I need to improve on focusing important tasks even if having other problematic situations or other stress.
